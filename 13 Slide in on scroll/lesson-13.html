      <h3>Ricky Mratin - Livin' la Vida Loca</h3>
      <p>
        She's into superstitions
        Black cats and voodoo dolls
        I feel a premonition
        That girl's gonna make me fall
        She's into new sensation
        New kicks in the candlelight
        She's got a new addiction
        For every day and night
        She'll make you take your
        Clothes off and go dancing in the rain
        She'll make you live her crazy life
        But she'll take away your pain
        Like a bullet to your brain
        <br />
        Upside inside out
        She's livin' la vida loca
        She'll push and pull you down
        Livin' la vida loca
        Her lips are devil red
        And her skin's the color of mocha
        She will wear you out
        Livin' la vida loca
        She's livin la vida loca
        <br />
        Woke up in New York City
        In a funky cheap hotel
        She took my heart
        And she took my money
        She must've slipped me a sleepin' pill
        She never drinks the water
        And makes you order
        French champagne
        Once you've has a taste of her
        You'll never be the same
        Yeah, she'll make you go insane
        <br />
        Upside inside out
        She's livin' la vida loca
        She'll push and pull you down
        Livin' la vida loca
        Her lips are devil red
        And her skin's the color of mocha
        She will wear you out
        Livin' la vida loca
        She's livin la vida loca
        <br />
        She'll make you take your
        Clothes off and go dancing in the rain
        She'll make you live her crazy life
        Until you go insane
        No, you'll never be the same
        Upside inside out
        She's livin' la vida loca
        She'll push and pull you down

      <h3>Limp bizkit - Behind blue eyes</h3>
      <p>
        no one knows what it's like
        to be the bad man
        to be the sad man
        behind blue eyes
        and no one knows
        what it's like to be hated
        to be faded to telling only lies
          <br />
        chorus:
        but my dreams they aren't as empty
        as my conscious seems to be
        i have hours, only lonely
        my love is vengeance
        that's never free
          <br />
        no one knows what its like
        to feel these feelings
        like i do, and i blame you!
        no one bites back as hard
        on their anger
        none of my pain woe
        can show through
          <br />
        chorus
          <br />
        discover l.i.m.p. say it (x4)
        no one knows what its like
        to be mistreated, to be defeated
        behind blue eyes
        no one know how to say
        that they're sorry and don't worry
        i'm not telling lies
          <br />
        chorus
          <br />
        no one knows what its like
        to be the bad man, to be the sad man
        behind blue eyes.
